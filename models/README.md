This folder contains models trained with either Wino-like or Higgsino-like neutralino samples. 1GeV, 5GeV and 10GeV correspond to the value of the cut on particles' PT. Digit at the end of folders' names label different members of the ensembles.

Folders for the 0th ensemble members contain subfolders with plots created for Winos, Higgsinos and Binos.
